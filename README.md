The code contains the simulations for the paper "Symmetry: a General Framework in Nonparametric Regression" by Louis G. Christie and John A. D. Aston.

The simulations cover two scenarios: 
  1) 3d_rotations_eg.py contains the code for Section 5.1 of the paper, and examines the performance of the best symmetric estimator when considering subgroups of the group of 3D rotations.
  2) translations_eg.py contains the code for Section 5.2 of the paper, and examines the performance of the best symmetric estimator when considering subgroups of the group of translations on the 2-Torus.
